## Background Information
- Module Version: ` `
- Node/Browser Version: ` `

The issue I'm reporting is with:
- [ ] json2csv
- [ ] csv2json

I have...
- [ ] searched to see if an issue has already been reported.
- [ ] verified that my JSON/CSV data is valid (using something like http://jsonlint.com or https://csvlint.io/).
- [ ] tried upgrading to the latest version of json-2-csv (since the issue may already be fixed).


## Expected Behavior


## Actual Behavior


## Data Sample 
CSV:
```csv

```

(or)

JSON:
```json

```


## Code Example
```javascript
// Please include a simple example to replicate the issue
let converter = require('json-2-csv');


```
